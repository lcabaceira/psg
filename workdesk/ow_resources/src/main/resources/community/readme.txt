 *********************************************************************

This ZIP-file contains the Alfresco Workdesk Community Edition with
a CMIS Adapter for connecting against any CMIS compliant repository
like an Alfresco repository.


======================================================================
1. Prerequisites
======================================================================

You only need a web application server. We recommend that you use the 
web application server Apache Tomcat for deploying the Alfresco 
Wordesk, since we have fully tested this combination. You can download 
Apache Tomcat at 
   --> http://tomcat.apache.org/.


======================================================================
2. Before Deploying
======================================================================
There are two ways to get an instance of Wordesk up-and-running
for the 1st time, described in 2.1. and 2.2 below.
 
2.1 Quick and Easy
==================
You can follow the instructions of chapter 3 "Quick and Easy Deployment", 
to get a first impression of Wordesk running on top of an Alfresco 
online repository. For this deployment method you should be familiar
with your web application server, otherwise you should use the Quickstart
Guide.
    
2.2 Quickstart Guide
====================
You can use the Quickstart Guide, which describes how to connect to an 
online or locally installed instance of an Alfresco repository.
    
The Quickstart Guide also explains how to prepare the Alfresco repository
and Wordesk to get an example solution of a fully functional Human 
Resources application, which could be used to create and manage employee
dossiers.

The Quickstart Guide also gives more details of tools, documentation 
and sample applications coming with this ZIP-file.

Please find additional information and documentation here:

======================================================================
3. Quick and Easy Deployment
======================================================================

Step 1: Deploying
   Extract the ZIP-file and copy the Folder "workdesk" (located in the 
   "bin" folder of the ZIP-file) to your web application server. 
   If you are using Apache Tomcat, you simply need to copy the
   folder to the [TomcatRoot]\webapps\ directory.

Step 2: Accessing Wordesk
   Enter the URL to the Wordesk deployment in your favorite
   web browser by using the following standard format
   --> http://[HostName]:[Port]/[DeploymentName]

   If you are using Apache Tomcat with its default configurations,
   please use 
   --> http://localhost:8080/workdesk. 

Step 3: Login
   The login screen of Wordesk appears. Wordesk is
   configured by default, to connect to an online Alfresco 
   repository. Valid credentials are username "admin" and 
   password "admin" for this online Alfresco repository.
