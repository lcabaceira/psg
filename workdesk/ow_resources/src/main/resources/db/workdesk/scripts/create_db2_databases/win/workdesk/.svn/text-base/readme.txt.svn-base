How to use the create_OWDDB.bat:

Open the DB2 Command Window (Windows->Run: db2cmd) and navigate to the batch file.
Type create_OWDDB.bat for parameter syntax and usage examples.

Please note that in case of Windows OS, the DB2 Command Window implicitly uses the user you are currently logged on to Windows.
This user is getting owner rights (all rights) for the database you create.
Additionally, the user you name as fourth parameter, gets the connect to and create table right.
