Alfresco Workdesk Rendition/Thumbnail Extension (AMP)
Copyright (c) Alfresco Software, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Due to the fact, that there are some dependent libraries already delivered
with a vanilla Alfresco instance or that some of them are already available
in a later version, it is required to check the following libraries on 
the Alfresco side (/lib/ folder).

- commons-codec-1.5.jar 
- commons-logging-1.1.1.jar 
- httpclient-4.1.1.jar 
- httpcore-4.1.jar  
- jackson-core-asl-1.9.8.jar 
- jackson-mapper-asl-1.9.8.jar

These libraries (or later versions) are required by the Rendition AMP,
but are not delivered and deployed by the Rendition AMP file.
